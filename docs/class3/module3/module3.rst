Module 3: Shifting WAF policy left, closer to DEV
=================================================

In this module you will review the lab environment, practice some of the concepts discussed in class:
 - break down the silos, enable dev to deploy securely with minimum friction
 - introduce security as early on in the dev chain as possible
 - automated security tests
 - roles of secops and dev in our lab model and deploy an app to prod with WAF protection.
