Lab |labmodule|\.\ |labnum|\: Create Tenant & BIG-IP Connector
--------------------------------------------------------------

iWorkflow implements a Tenant/Provider interface to enable abstracted deployment
of L4-7 into various environment.  In conjuction iWorkflow Connectors serve as
the L1-3 Network and Device Onboarding automation component in the automation
toolchain. iWorkflow supports Connectors for various vendor integrations
(F5 vCMP, F5 BIG-IP, Cisco APIC, vmWare NSX, etc.) In this lab we will create a
‘BIG-IP Connector’ for the BIG-IP devices in the lab deployment. This
connector will then allow you to drive a fully automated deployment from
the iWorkflow Service Catalog.

Task 1 - Create a Tenant and Tenant User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this task we will create a Local Connector that is linked to our
BIG-IP devices. The Local Cloud Connector is DSC aware and will
automatically detect that the BIG-IP devices are clustered and configure
itself accordingly.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

#. Expand the "Lab 2.3 - Create Tenant & Local Connector" folder in the Postman
   collection.

#. Click the "Step 1: Create iWorkflow Tenant" item in the collection and click
   'Send'.  This request will create a tenant named ``MyTenant``.

#. Click the "Step 2: Create Tenant User" item in the collection and click
   'Send'.  This request will create a **tenant** user.

#. Click the "Step 3: Assign User to Tenant Admin Role" item in the collection
   and click 'Send'.  This request will assign the Admin role for the
   ``MyTenant`` tenant to the ``tenant`` user.

Task 2 - Create a Local Connector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Click the "Step 4: Create a Local Connector" item in the
   collection. We will create a new connector by performing a POST to
   the local connector collection. If you examine the JSON body you
   can see we are providing a reference to the URL for the BIG-IP-A
   device (using the UUID environment variable we populated earlier):

#. Click the ‘Send’ button to create the connector.

#. Click the "Step 5: Get Local Connectors" item in the collection and
   click ‘Send’. Examine the output to see how the connector was
   configured. Take note of the reference to the ‘device-group’. This
   is how the connector determines the HA state of the underlying
   BIG-IP devices. Find the ‘connectorId’ of the connector and update
   your Postman environment to include the ‘connectorId’ as the value
   of the ‘iwf\_connector\_uuid’ variable:

#. Click the "Step 6: Assign Connector to Tenant" item in the
   collection. This request will assign this connector to
   to the ‘MyTenant’ tenant allowing service deployments from that
   tenant. Click the ‘Send’ button and examine the response.
