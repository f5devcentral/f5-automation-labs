In this module we will explore how to use F5’s iWorkflow platform to
further abstract application services and deliver those services to
tenants. iWorkflow has two main purposes in the Automation &
Orchestration toolchain:

-  Provide simplified but customizable Device Onboarding workflows

-  Provide a tenant/provider interface for L4 - L7 service delivery

When moving to an iWorkflow based toolchain it’s important to understand
that L1-3 Automation (Device Onboarding, Networking, etc) and L4-7
(Deployment of Virtual Servers, Pools, etc) are separated and delivered
by different features.

L1-3 Networking and Device Onboarding are delivered by ‘Cloud
Connectors’ that are specific to the third party technology ecosystem
(e.g. vCMP, Cisco APIC, VMware NSX, BIG-IP, etc).

L4-7 service delivery is accomplished by:

-  **Declarative:** Consuming F5 iApp templates from BIG-IP devices and
   creating a Service Catalog.

-  **Imperative:** Consuming the iWorkflow REST Proxy to drive API calls to
   BIG-IP devices

The labs in the module will focus on the high level features in place to
achieve full L1-7 automation. As mentioned above, iApps are a key
component of this toolchain. 

In this Module we will focus on building a **Service Catalog** using the App
Services iApp template you learned about in Module 2.  The focus in Module 2
was showing how to drive rich deployments, however, a large amount of F5 
**Domain Specific Knowledge** was still required to drive the deployments.
From a conceptual view iApp templates alone do not fully satisfy the requirement
for a fully **Declarative** interface because while the iApp template simplies
the underlying **Imperative** actions it does not allow the adminstrator to 
built an **Interface** that minimizes or eliminates the need for **Domain 
Specific Knowledge**.

For example, we deployed a service that enabled HTTP Traffic Management with 
an iRule attached and Profile Customizations.  To the F5 administrator these 
are all very familar terms, however, to a consumer, such as an Application 
Owner, the terms *Virtual Server*, *iRule*, *Profile*, etc. are foreign 
concepts.  To solve this problem iWorkflow allows the adminstrator to create 
a **Service Catalog Template** that is an **Abstraction** of the iApp templates
input fields.  By doing this the F5 administrator can **create an interface 
tailored to the use case and knowledge level of the CONSUMER rather than the
ADMINSTRATOR**, enabling full featured and complex Layer 4-7 Application 
and Security services that are tailored to business need and use case rather
than the technical implementation.  Additionally, the **Service Abstraction**
acheived when creating the **Service Catalog** enables the easy integration of
F5 services with third-party tools and methodologies such as DevOps.
