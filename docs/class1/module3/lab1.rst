      }
   }

In this lab we will use the :guilabel:`Runner`, introduced in previous labs to
complete the onboarding of the Ansible Tower device.  The onboarding process
creates the initial configuration required to start utilizing Ansible Tower with
BIG-IP.

Ansible Tower Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before looking at the details of the onboarding process, lets discuss the new
components Ansible Tower introduces to our toolchain. Some of the components are
general Ansible terms and
not specific to Tower. As mentioned earlier we will be focusing primarily on the
concepts within Tower itself.

Ansible Tower Term Reference
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Inventory:** Device(s) to perform action against. In this lab we will be 
  using bigip_a_mgmt as the inventory object.
- **Playbook:** A group of plays/tasks to be performed against devices within
  the **Inventory**.
- **Project:** A collection of Ansible **Playbooks** within tower. In this lab
  were are using a **GIT Repo** to store the playbooks.
- **Templates:** A template provides the ability supply parameters to a playbook.
  Templates are what will provide the **Abstraction** to
  AS3.
- **Credentials:** Used to authenticate Tower to the destination device within
  the **Inventory**.

Roll Based Access Control (RBAC)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ansible Tower provides a control hierarchy with the terms below:

- **Orginization (AS3 Tenant):** An organization is a logical collection
  of **Users, Teams, Projects, and Inventories**. It is the highest level in the
  Tower object hierarchy.
- **Team:** A subdivision of an organization with associated **Users, Projects,
  Credentials, and Permissions**.
- **User:** A Users is usually associated with a **Team** to allow for group
  based RBAC control.

Example of the RBAC structure being used in this lab:


-  Tenant1 (Orginization)

   -  T1-Admins (Team)

      -  T1-admin-user (User)

   -  T1-Ops (Team)

      -  T1-ops-user (User)


Source-of-Truth
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As discussed in Module 2, it is key to keep source-of-truth in mind as Tower
will be making changes through F5's declarative AS3 interface. For this lab we
have created an AS3 declaration (source-of-truth) file for each of the primary
**Service Examples** from the previous Module. The intent here is to demonstrate
the ability of Tower to manage and push source-of-truth 
declarations from within its **Project (GIT SCM)**.

Onboarding Process Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The process implemented in the ``Lab 3.1 - Ansible Tower Onboarding`` folder of
the Postman collection is outlined below. The items will be done
**automatically** for you during **Task1**.

#. Token Authentication
#. Setup RBAC

   -  Create Orginization **Tenant1**

   -  Create Teams ( **T1-Admin / T1-Ops** )

   -  Create Users ( **T1-admin-user / T1-ops-user** )

   -  Associate Users to their respective Teams

#. Create Tower Project SCM
#. Create Tower Inventory

   -  Create Tower Inventory group

   -  Create Inventory Host (The BIG-IP we will be manipulating)

   -  Associate the Host to the Inventory group

#. Create Tower Credentials to Authenticate to the BIG-IP
#. Create Job Templates

   -  Deploy Config (POSTS AS3 Declaration to BIG-IP)

   -  Add Pool Member to Pool

   -  Remove Pool Member from Pool

   -  Replace All Members in a Pool

   -  Update the SSL CRT/KEY for a Virtual

   -  View Current Config on AS3 Tenant


#. Create Tower Survey for each Template (Ability to collect Variables)
#. Associate each Template above with the Following RBAC Team/Role

   -  Admins

      -  Deploy Config

      -  View Current Config

   -  Operations

      -  Add Pool Member

      -  Remove Pool Member

      -  Replace Pool Members

      -  Update SSL CRT/KEY

      -  View Current Config


Task 1 - Onboard Ansible Tower using Runner
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this task we will use the :guilabel:`Runner` to execute a series of
requests contained in the ``Lab 3.1 - Ansible Tower Onboarding`` folder.

Perform the following steps to build the cluster:

#. Click the :guilabel:`Runner` button at the top left of your Postman window:

   |postman-runner-button|

#. Select the ``F5 Programmability: Class 1`` Collection then the
   ``Lab 3.1 - Ansible Tower Onboarding`` folder.  Next, be sure the
   environment is set to ``F5 Programmability: Class 1``:

   |lab-1-1|

#. Click the :guilabel:`Run Lab 3.1 - Ansib...` button

#. The results window will now populate.  You will see each request in the
   folder is sent and it's associated test results are displayed on the screen.
   Onboarding Ansible Tower about a minute.  You can follow the progress
   by scrolling down the results window.

#. Once the :guilabel:`Run Summary` button appears the folder has finished
   running.  You should have 0 failures and the last item in the request
   list should be named ``Step 6: Permissions (Pool Member Del Ops)``

   |lab-1-2|

#. At this point you can log into Ansible Tower using Chrome at
   ``https://10.1.1.4`` and ``admin/admin`` credentials. Browse the main UI tabs
   to see the different topics covered at the top of this lab
   (Projects, Inventories, Templates, etc).

   |lab-1-3|

#. Select the **Settings Icon** in the top right corner to view the **RBAC**
   items that were created such as Orginization, Teams, Users, and Credentials.
