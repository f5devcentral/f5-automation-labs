         onboarding -> templates -> catalog -> deployments
      }
   }

In this lab we will use the :guilabel:`Runner`, introduced in previous labs to 
complete the onboarding of the F5 iWorkflow device.  The onboarding process
creates the initial configuration required to start creation of Service 
Catalog Templates.

iWorkflow Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before looking at the details of the onboarding process, lets discuss the new
components iWorkflow introduces to our toolchain.

Device Discovery
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order for iWorkflow to interact with a BIG-IP device it must be
discovered by iWorkflow. The device discovery process leverages the
existing CMI Device Trust infrastructure on BIG-IP. Currently there is a
limitation that a single BIG-IP device can only be ‘discovered’ by ONE
of iWorkflow or BIG-IQ CM at a time. In this lab will we discover the
existing BIG-IP devices from your lab environment.

Tenants & Connectors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

iWorkflow implements a Tenant/Provider interface to enable abstracted deployment
of L4-7 into various environment.  In conjunction iWorkflow Connectors serve as
the L1-3 Network and Device Onboarding automation component in the automation
toolchain.  In this lab we will create a ‘BIG-IP Connector’ for the BIG-IP 
devices in the lab environment. This connector will then allow you to drive a 
fully automated deployment from the iWorkflow Service Catalog.

iApp Templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

iWorkflow serves as an iApp Template Source-of-Truth for discovered BIG-IP 
devices.  This allows an F5 administrator to manage iApp templates in a single
place with iWorkflow installing required templates on BIG-IP devices as 
required **during** service deployment. 

Onboarding Process Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The process implemented in the ``Lab 3.1 - iWorkflow Onboarding`` folder of 
the Postman collection is diagrammed below.  

.. NOTE:: The diagram below represents environment variables in blue.  You can
   follow the lines on each variable to understand which request populates the
   variable and how they are subsequently used.

Task 1 - Onboard iWorkflow using Runner
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this task we will use the :guilabel:`Runner` to execute a series of
requests contained in the ``Lab 3.1 - iWorkflow Onboarding`` folder.  

Perform the following steps to build the cluster:

#. Click the :guilabel:`Runner` button at the top right of your Postman window:

   |image97|

#. Select the ``F5 Programmability: Class 1`` Collection then the
   ``Lab 3.1 - iWorkflow Onboarding`` folder.  Next, be sure the
   environment is set to ``F5 Programmability: Class 1``:

   |image41|

#. Click the :guilabel:`Run Lab 3.1 - iWor...` button

#. The results window will now populate.  You will see each request in the
   folder is sent and it's associated test results are displayed on the screen.
   Onboarding iWorkflow can take a few minutes.  You can follow the progress
   by scrolling down the results window.

#. Once the :guilabel:`Run Summary` button appears the folder has finished
   running.  You should have 0 failures and the last item in the request
   list should be named ``Install App Services Template on iWorkflow``

   |image42|

#. At this point you can log into iWorkflow using Chrome at 
   ``https://10.1.1.12`` and ``admin/admin`` credentials.  Click 
   :guilabel:`Clouds and Services` at the top of the window:

#. Browse the various panes to see what was created:
