Lab |labmodule|\.\ |labnum|\: Build a BIG-IP Cluster using a Collection
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In this lab we will build a active-standby cluster between BIG-IP-A and
BIG-IP-B. As mentioned previously, to save time, BIG-IP-B is already licensed
and had its device level settings configured. This
lab will walk you through creating the cluster step by step. As you will
see, complex operations such as this start to become less effective using
the **Imperative** model of automation. Clustering is one of the
‘transition’ points for most customers to move into the **Declarative**
model (if not already done) due to the need to abstract device/vendor
level specifics from Automation consumers.

The high-level procedure required to create the cluster is:

#.  Rename the CMI ‘Self’ Device name to match the hostname of the
    Device

#.  Set BIGIP-A & BIGIP-B CMI Parameters (Config Sync IP, Failover
    IPs, Mirroring IP)

#.  Add BIG-IP-B as a trusted peer on BIGIP-A

#.  Check the device\_trust\_group Sync Group Status

#.  Create a sync-failover Device Group

#.  Check the status of the created Device Group

#.  Perform initial sync of the Device Group

#.  Check status (again)

#.  Change the Traffic Group to use HA Order failover (not required but
    shown as an example)

#. Create Floating Self IPs

Task 1 - Rename objects and Setup CMI Global Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this task we will complete Items 1&2 from the list high-level
procedure at the beginning of the lab. One of the idiosyncrasies of
BIG-IP is that when you use the GUI Setup Wizard to set the hostname of
the device, the wizard automatically renames the CMI ‘Self’ device to
match the hostname. Since we configured the hostname via a REST call
earlier this action did not take place.

Perform the following steps to rename the CMI ‘Self’ device:

#. Expand the "Lab 1.5 - Build a Cluster" folder in the Postman
   collection

#. Click the "Step 1: Rename the CMI Self Device’ item in the collection

#. Examine the URI and JSON body. We are sending a POST request to
   execute the equivalent of a tmsh ``mv`` command to rename the
   existing object to the ``/mgmt/tm/cm/device`` Collection.
   The ``name`` attribute specifies the current name of the object (the
   factory default name), while the ``target`` attribute specifies the
   new name of the object.

#. Click the ‘Send’ button to rename the Resource.

#. Change the request type from a POST to a GET and click ‘Send’.
   Examine the response to make sure the name was changed successfully.

Perform the following steps to set CMI Device Parameters

#. Click the "Step 2: Set BIGIP-A CMI Device Parameters" item in the
   collection. Examine the operation (PATCH), URI and JSON body. We
   will PATCH the newly renamed object (from the previous step) and
   assign the Config Sync IP, Unicast Failover Address/Port and
   Mirroring IPs:

   |image28|

#. Click the ‘Send’ button and examine the response to ensure the
   settings were changed

#. Click the "Step 3: Set BIGIP-B CMI Device Parameters" item in the
   collection. Examine the operation (PATCH), URI and JSON body. We
   will PATCH and assign the Config Sync IP, Unicast Failover Address/Port and
   Mirroring IPs.

   *EXTRA CREDIT: How is authentication to BIG-IP-B working if we never
   got an authentication token? (Hint: we cheated)*

#. Click the ‘Send’ button and examine the response to ensure the
   settings were changed

Task 2 - Add BIG-IP-B as a Trusted Peer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CMI subsystem relies on a PKI based device trust model to establish
relationships between BIG-IP systems. In this task we will add BIG-IP-B
as a trusted peer of BIG-IP-A. Establishing a trust relationship is
automatically a bi-directional operation. As a result, when we establish
the trust relationship, BIG-IP-B will automatically establish a trust
relationship with BIG-IP-A. This task corresponds to items 3&4 in the
high-level procedure.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

#. Click the "Step 4: Add BIGIP-B Device to CMI Trust on BIGIP-A" item
   in the collection

#. Examine the operation (POST), URI and JSON body. We are using a
   special REST worker to add the device to the CMI trust. Additionally
   the JSON body must be specified in a very specific manner to ensure
   this step completes successfully. To minimize the chance for error
   the values have been completed for you already. You should, however,
   review and understand this step fully before continuing.

#. Click the ‘Send’ button. The response for this request does NOT
   indicate success, only that the command is running.

#. To check for success we have to check the status of the Sync Group
   named "device\_trust\_group". To do this click the "Step 5: Check
   Sync Group Status" item in the collection. This request will GET the
   sync status for all sync groups on the system

#. Click the ‘Send’ button and examine the response. The status should
   indicate a color of ‘green’, that bigip-b.f5.local is connected
   and ‘In Sync’ (please notify an instructor of any issue):

Task 3 - Create a sync-failover Device Group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This task will create a Device Group object that will contain the two
BIG-IP systems. The type of device-group will be a ‘sync-failover’
group, however, ‘sync-only’ groups can also be created with the same
procedure but different attribute values. This task corresponds to items
5-8 in the high-level procedure.

Perform the following steps to complete this task

#. Click the "Step 6: Create Device Group" item in the collection.
   Examine the request type, URL and JSON body. We will POST to the
   ‘/mgmt/tm/cm/device-group’ collection and create a new Resource
   called DeviceGroup1 that includes both BIG-IP devices and is set to
   ‘sync-failover’ type. We are also setting the device-group to
   ‘autosync’ so manual syncing is not required when configuration
   changes occur:

   |image30|

#. Click the ‘Send’ button and examine the response.

#. To check the status of the device-group we have to check the status
   of the underlying sync group on the system. Click the ‘Step 7:
   Check Sync Group Status’ item in the collection and click ‘Send’.
   Examine the response and take note that the system is ‘Awaiting
   Initial Sync’:

   |image31|

#. We will now manually sync DeviceGroup1 to fulfill the need for the
   Initial Sync. Click the ‘Step 8: Manually Sync DeviceGroup1’ item
   in the collection. Examine the request type, URL and JSON body. We
   will POST to the ‘/mgmt/tm/cm/config-sync’ worker and tell it to
   ‘run’ a config-sync of BIG-IP-A ‘to-group’ DeviceGroup1:

   |image32|

#. Click ‘Send’ to initiate the sync

#. Click the ‘Step 9: Check Sync Group Status’ item in the collection
   and click the ‘Send’ button. Examine the response to make sure that
   DeviceGroup1 is ‘In Sync’. You may have to click ‘Send’ multiple
   times as the sync operation can take a while to complete.

Task 4 - Perform Additional Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The remainder of the steps show how to manipulate various common items
related to the HA config. In this task we will change the Traffic Group
to use the ‘HA Order’ failover method. We will then initiate a failover
and show how to view the status of the traffic-group.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

#. Click the "Step 10: Get Traffic Group Properties" item in the
   collection. Examine the URL, we will GET the attributes of the
   ‘traffic-group-1’ resource from the traffic-group collection. Click
   the ‘Send’ button and review the response.

#. Click the "Step 11: Change Traffic Group to use HA Order" item in the
   collection. Examine the request type, URL and JSON body. We will
   PATCH the existing resource and specify an ‘haOrder’ attribute to
   change the traffic-group behavior.

#. Click the ‘Send’ button and examine the response to verify the change
   was successful.

#. Click the "Step 12: Get Traffic Group Failover States" item in the
   collection and click the ‘Send’ button. Examine the response and
   determine which device is ‘active’ for the traffic-group:

   |image33|

#. Click EITHER the "Step 13A" or "Step 13B" item in the collection
   depending on which device is ACTIVE for the traffic group. Notice
   that we are sending the request to the ACTIVE device for the traffic
   group. Examine the JSON body and click the ‘Send’ button.

#. Click the "Step 14: Get Traffic Group Failover States" item in the
   collection and click the ‘Send’ button. Examine the response to
   determine that the failover occurred properly:

   |image34|

Task 5 - Create Floating Self IPs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To complete the HA config we will now create a Floating Self IP on the
Internal VLAN.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

#. Click the "Step 15: Create a Floating Self IP" item in the
   collection. Examine the request type, URL and JSON body. We will
   create a new resource in the ``/mgmt/tm/net/self`` collection named
   ‘Self-Internal-Floating’ and an IP address of 10.1.10.3.

#. Click the ‘Send’ button and examine the response

#. Click the "Step 16: Get Self IPs" item in the collection and click
   ‘Send’. Examine the response and verify the Self IP was created.
