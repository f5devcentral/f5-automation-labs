Lab |labmodule|\.\ |labnum|\: Review/Set Device Settings
--------------------------------------------------------

Your BIG-IP-A device is already licensed, so now we can focus on
configuring the basic infrastructure related settings to complete the
Device Onboarding process. The remaining items include (list not
exhaustive):

-  Device Settings

   -  **NTP/DNS Settings**

   -  Remote Authentication

   -  **Hostname**

   -  **Admin Credentials**

-  L1-3 Networking

   -  Physical Interface Settings

   -  L2 Connectivity (**VLAN**, VXLAN, etc.)

   -  L3 Connectivity (**Self IPs, Routing**, etc.)

-  HA Settings

   -  **Global Settings**

      -  **Config Sync IP**

      -  **Mirroring IP**

      -  **Failover Addresses**

   -  **CMI Device Trusts**

   -  **Device Groups**

   -  **Traffic Groups**

   -  **Floating Self IPs**

We will specifically cover the items in **BOLD** above in the following
labs. It should be noted that many permutations of the Device Onboarding
process exist due to the nature of customer environments. This class is
designed to teach enough information so that you can then apply the
knowledge learned and help articulate and/or deliver a specific solution
for your environment.

Task 1 – Set Device Hostname & Disable GUI Setup Wizard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this task we will modify the device hostname and disable the GUI
Setup Wizard. The Resource that contains these settings is
``/mgmt/tm/sys/global-settings``.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

#. Expand the “Lab 1.3 – Review/Set Device Settings” folder in the
   Postman collection

#. Click the “Step 1: Get System Global-Settings” item. Click the ‘Send’
   button and review the response body to see what the current settings
   on the device are.

#. Click the “Step 2: Set System Global-Settings” item. This item uses
   a PATCH request to the ``global-settings`` resource to modify the
   attributes contained within it. We will update the ``guiSetup`` and
   ``hostname`` attribute.

   - Review the JSON body and modify the ‘hostname’ attribute to set the
     hostname to ``bigip-a.f5.local``

   - Also notice that we are disabling the GUI Setup Wizard as part of
     the same request:

#. Click the ‘Send’ button and review the response body. You should see
   that the attributes modified above have been updated. You can also
   GET the global-settings again to verify they have been updated.

Task 2 – Modify DNS/NTP Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. NOTE:: This task will make use of JSON arrays.  The syntax for defining a 
   JSON array is:

   ``myArray: [ Object0, Object1 ... ObjectX ]``

   To define an array consisting of Strings the syntax is:

   ``myStringArray: [ "string0", "string1" ... "stringX" ]``

Much like the previous task we can update system DNS and NTP settings by
sending a PATCH request to the correct resource in the ‘sys’ Organizing
Collection. The relevant Resources for this task are:

+------------------------+----------------+
| URL                    | Type           |
+========================+================+
| ``/mgmt/tm/sys/dns``   | DNS Settings   |
+------------------------+----------------+
| ``/mgmt/tm/sys/ntp``   | NTP Settings   |
+------------------------+----------------+

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

#. Click the “Step 3: Get System DNS Settings” item in the collection.
   Click ‘Send’ and review the current settings

#. Click the “Step 4: Set System DNS Settings” item in the collection.
   Review the JSON body to verify the name server IPs ``4.2.2.2`` and
   ``8.8.8.8`` are listed. Additionally add a search domain of ‘f5.local’. You
   will modify a JSON array for both of these attributes.

#. Click the ‘Send’ button and verify the requested changes were
   successfully implemented

#. Click the “Step 5: Get System NTP Settings” item in the collection.
   Click ‘Send’ and review the current settings

#. Click the “Step 6: Set System NTP Settings” item in the collection.
   Review the JSON body to verify the NTP servers with hostnames
   ``0.pool.ntp.org`` and ``1.pool.ntp.org`` are contained in the ``servers``
   attribute (another JSON array!)

#. Click the ‘Send’ button and verify the requested changes were
   successfully implemented

Task 3 – Update default user account passwords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this task we will update the passwords for the ‘root’ and ‘admin’
accounts. The process for updating the root account is different then
other system accounts due to the special nature of the root account.

To update the root account password we will use a POST to a shared REST
worker at ``/mgmt/shared/authn/root``

To update all other system accounts we will PATCH the
``/mgmt/auth/user/<username>`` Resource

Perform the following steps to change the **root** user password:

#. Click the “Step 7: Set root User Password” item in the collection.

#. Notice that we a performing a POST operation to a shared REST
   worker. Modify the JSON body to update the password to the value
   “newdefault” and click the ‘Send’ button.

   |image26|

#. You can verify the password was changed by opening an SSH session
   using PuTTY to BIG-IP-A.

#. **Repeat the procedure above to change the password back to
   “default”**

Perform the following steps to change the **admin** user password:

#. Click the “Step 8: Set admin User Password” item in the collection.

#. Notice that we a performing a PATCH operation to admin user
   Resource. Modify the JSON body to update the password to the value
   “newadmin” and click the ‘Send’ button.

   |image27|

#. You can verify the password was changed by opening an SSH session
   using PuTTY to BIG-IP-A OR by logging into TMUI in a Chrome browser
   tab.

#. **Repeat the procedure above to change the password back to “admin”**
