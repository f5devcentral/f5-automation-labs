Lab 2.3: Application Service Deployments with AS3
-------------------------------------------------

.. graphviz::

   digraph breadcrumb {
      rankdir="LR"
      ranksep=.4
      node [fontsize=10,style="rounded,filled",shape=box,color=gray72,margin="0.05,0.05",height=0.1]
      fontsize = 10
      labeljust="l"
      subgraph cluster_provider {
         style = "rounded,filled"
         color = lightgrey
         height = .75
         label = "AS3 Installation & Deployments"
         basics [label="AS3 Basics",color="palegreen"]
         templates [label="AS3 Installation",color="palegreen"]
         deployments [label="AS3 Deployments",color="steelblue1"]
         basics -> templates -> deployments
      }
   }

Now that AS3 has been installed on your BIG-IP device, we can deploy new 
Layer 4 to 7 App Services.  First we'll review the structure of an AS3 
declaration.  Then we will **Create** a Basic HTTP Service, demonstrate two ways 
to **Modify/Mutate** the service by changing the pool member states and 
adding pool members, and finally **Delete** the service.  Once we've 
demonstrated these tasks, we'll introduce more complex deployment options 
with iRules, Custom Profiles, Certificates, and an ASM Policy.


AS3 Declaration Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. NOTE:: This lab covers a very small subset of the schema AS3 implements.  
   The complete AS3 schema is documented in the 
   `AS3 Schema Reference <http://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/3/refguide/schema-reference.html>`__

The AS3 declaration is a JSON-based schema document.  The schema implements
various nested ``class`` attributes that define the acceptable input attributes
and values.  The simplest useful representation of an AS3 declaration can be
depicted as:

.. graphviz::

   digraph declaration { 
     node [fontsize=10,style="rounded,filled",shape=box,color=orange,margin="0.05,0.05",height=0.1]
     fontsize = 10
     labeljust="l"
     fontname = "Arial";
             
     subgraph cluster_as3 { 
       style = "rounded,filled"
       color = lightgrey
       label = "class: AS3"; 

       subgraph cluster_adc { 
         style = "rounded,filled"
         color = lightblue
         label = "class: ADC"; 

         subgraph cluster_tenant1 { 
           style = "rounded,filled"
           color = lightgreen
           label = "class: Tenant"; 
            
           subgraph cluster_app { 
             style = "rounded,filled"
             color = lightyellow
             label = "class: Application"; 
             dots [ label = ". . ."]
           } 
         } 
       } 
     } 
   }

Let's start by defining out outermost ``AS3`` class:

.. code-block:: json
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 4-6

   {
      "class": "AS3",
      "action": "deploy",
      "declaration": {
        "class": "ADC"
      }
   }

The ``AS3`` class defines various parameters that control how AS3 executes.
  
.. NOTE:: The available attributes for the ``AS3`` class are documented in the 
   `AS3 Class <http://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/3/refguide/schema-reference.html#as3>`__
   section of the schema reference.

In the example above, the ``declaration`` attribute is highlighted.  Since the
``AS3`` class is the top-level class this attribute is special; it is a
container used to specify our next class, ``ADC``:

.. code-block:: json
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 6,8-16

   {
      "class": "AS3",
      "action": "deploy",
      "declaration": {
        "class": "ADC",
        "schemaVersion": "3.0.0",
        "id": "Super-NetOps Class 1 AS3 Schema Example"
        "Tenant1": { 
          "class": "Tenant"
        },
        "Tenant2": {
          "class": "Tenant"
        },
        "TenantN": {
          "class": "Tenant"
        }       
      }
   }

The ``ADC`` class defines various parameters that control how ADC-centric 
Application Centric services are configured.  This is the first time we've 
seen the ``schemaVersion`` attribute. As mentioned previously AS3 implements 
robust versioning to preserve backwards compatibility while still allowing 
rapid updates and schema extensions.  The ``schemaVersion`` is de-coupled with 
the **Release Version** of AS3.  This allows you to use the latest released 
versions of AS3 while still ensuring that existing declarations continue to 
function.  Schema changes and additions are always implemented in a new 
``schemaVersion`` and can be migrated to in a controlled manner.  To highlight 
this, notice that the ``schemaVersion`` is ``3.0.0`` while the installed release 
of AS3 is ``3.1.0``.

.. NOTE:: The available attributes for the ``ADC`` class are documented in the 
   `ADC Class <http://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/3/refguide/schema-reference.html#adc>`__
   section of the schema reference.

The second group of highlighted lines in the example above are containers used
to define tenants.  Note that there are multiple tenant containers in this
example.  AS3 is inherently multi-tenant and AS3 **Tenants** map to 
**Partitions** on a BIG-IP system.  In this case the **Partition** names on 
BIG-IP would be the same as the name of the attributes: ``Tenant1``,
``Tenant2`` and ``TenantN``.  This class is an introduction so we will only
deploy a single tenant.

.. NOTE:: The available attributes for the ``Tenant`` class are documented in the 
   `Tenant Class <http://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/3/refguide/schema-reference.html#tenant>`__
   section of the schema reference.

Next, let's populate our tenant ``Tenant1`` with a our next class, 
``Application``:

.. code-block:: json
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 10-18

   {
      "class": "AS3",
      "action": "deploy",
      "declaration": {
        "class": "ADC",
        "schemaVersion": "3.0.0",
        "id": "Super-NetOps Class 1 AS3 Schema Example"
        "Tenant1": { 
          "class": "Tenant"
          "App1": {
            "class": "Application"
          },
          "App2": {
            "class": "Application"
          },
          "AppN": {
            "class": "Application"
          }
        }      
      }
   }

As you can see we've defined three applications, ``App1``, ``App2`` and ``AppN``.
Inside each ``Application`` container we will populate more objects that define
the specific configuration for an Application Service.  Adding new applications
is as simple as adding a new object with a ``Application`` class.  This pattern 
can be repeated for as many applications as required.

.. NOTE:: The available attributes for the ``Application`` class are documented in the 
   `Application Class <http://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/3/refguide/schema-reference.html#application>`__
   section of the schema reference.

Now that we see how our declaration is structured let's show an example that 
defines a simple HTTP Application Service that implements Load Balancing:

.. code-block:: json
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 10-33

   {
      "class": "AS3",
      "action": "deploy",
      "declaration": {
          "class": "ADC",
          "schemaVersion": "3.0.0",
          "id": "Super-NetOps Class 1 AS3 Schema Example"
          "Tenant1": {
              "class": "Tenant",
              "HTTP_Service": {
                  "class": "Application",
                  "template": "http",
                  "serviceMain": {
                      "class": "Service_HTTP",
                      "virtualAddresses": [
                          "10.1.20.121"
                      ],
                      "pool": "Pool1"
                  },
                  "Pool1": {
                      "class": "Pool",
                      "monitors": [ "http" ],
                      "members": [
                        {
                          "servicePort": 80,
                          "serverAddresses": [
                             "10.1.10.100",
                             "10.1.10.101"
                          ]
                        }
                      ]
                  }
              }            
          }
      }
   }

The highlighted lines implement a Virtual Server listening on ``10.1.20.121:80``
with a single pool that contains two pool members.  It is important note the
use of the ``template`` attribute.  In this case, we are using the ``http``
template provided by AS3 to set various defaults for this service.  Some of 
those defaults include:

- Listen on ``TCP/80``
- Cookie persistence
- Default HTTP Profile w/ the ``X-Forwarded-For`` header inserted
- See the `reference <http://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/3/refguide/schema-reference.html#service-http>`_ 
  for full details

Now that we understand how declarations are defined let's go through some 
examples.  While completing the following tasks be sure to review the JSON
:guilabel:`Body` of the requests to how the declaration is defined.

Task 1 - View Deployed Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. NOTE:: This lab work will be performed from
   ``Lab 2.3 - Application Service Deployments with AS3`` folder in the
   Postman Collection

   |lab-3-1|

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

#. :guilabel:`Send` the ``Step 1: Get Deployed AS3 Services``
   request to view current declarations on the BIG-IP device:

   |lab-3-2|

#. Review the JSON Response :guilabel:`Body`.  AS3 does not currently have
   any declarations deployed on the BIG-IP device.  This is indicated in the
   ``message`` attribute:

   |lab-3-3|

Task 2 - Deploy HTTP_Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

#. Click ``Step 2: Deploy HTTP_Service``. Review the **Request** JSON
   :guilabel:`Body`. The JSON body of the POST contains the declaration AS3
   uses to deploy the service.

   |lab-3-4|

#. Click the :guilabel:`Send` button to **Create** HTTP_Service:

   |lab-3-5|

#. Review the **Response** JSON :guilabel:`Body` to verify if the Service has 
   been deployed.  AS3 will return a status for each Tenant in the declaration
   along with various statistics.  Pay special attention to the ``message``
   attribute.  In this case the value is ``success``, indicating that the
   configuration was deployed to the BIG-IP device successfully.  Additionally
   the implemented declaration is echoed back so it can be used to auditing 
   and verification as needed:

   |lab-3-6|

   .. NOTE:: We've just progressed into a **Declarative** instantiation, by
      defining the end state and relying on the AS3 to handle the
      order of operations and configuration of specific objects.  By doing this,
      we have drastically reduced the amount of **Domain Specific Knowledge**
      required to interact with the device.  In the next module, we will combine
      this concept with **Abstraction** to further simplify the interface the
      service consumer has to interact with.

#. To demonstrate **Idempotency**, let's repeat this operation.  Click the 
   :guilabel:`Send` button again to **Create** HTTP_Service.  Review the 
   **Response** JSON :guilabel:`Body` and notice that this time the ``message``
   attribute has a value of ``no change``.  Because the input declaration did 
   not change, AS3 simply validated the declaration but did not perform any 
   operations on the BIG-IP device.

   |lab-3-7|

#. Now that the service has been deployed, let's review the BIG-IP configuration.
   You can validate by sending the ``Step 1: Get Deployed AS3 Services``
   request again. 

   |lab-3-8|

#. In the TMUI GUI, you will now see a **Partition** has been created that 
   corresponds to the ``Tenant1`` tenant in our declaration.  We must first 
   select this partition in TMUI to view objects associated with it:

   |lab-3-9|

#. Examine the Virtual Server that was created by clicking 
   :menuselection:`Local Traffic --> Virtual Servers --> Virtual Server List 
   --> serviceMain`.  The configuration is simple, but it
   does contain the key components for an HTTP service (Listener, HTTP Profile,
   Monitor, Pool, and Pool Members):

   |lab-3-10|

#. The service is available and active; you can connect to the Virtual Server
   using Chrome web browser at ``http://10.1.20.121`` and examine its responses:

   |lab-3-11|

   .. NOTE:: The colors of the text, images, and borders may vary depending on the
      back-end server selected during the load balancing process.

Task 3 - Modify our Deployed Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this task, we will show how deployments can be modified with AS3.
It is important to understand that AS3 acts on the **Full** declaration
for each tenant.  Updates to deployments can be acheived in two ways:

#. Update the full declaration document and ``POST`` the entire declaration to 
   `/mgmt/shared/appsvcs/declare`.  AS3 will perform a *diff* operation and
   apply delta changes to the BIG-IP system to achieve the desired state.

#. Update an existing declaration by using the PATCH method along with 
   ``RFC6902`` JSON patch commands.  This allows you to edit the most recent
   declaration AS3 has deployed.  Once the RFC6902 ``PATCH`` is applied the 
   resulting full declaration is processed using the same *diff* operation
   as above.

   .. NOTE:: For more information on RFC6902 JSON Patching see 
      http://jsonpatch.com

.. WARNING:: Using the ``PATCH`` mechanism can result in a source-of-truth 
   violation if upstream orchestration systems are not updating their stored
   version of the declaration document.  The implications of this should be 
   fully understood and accounted for if using ``PATCH`` as part of a larger
   orchestrated workflow.

First, let's use the ``POST`` method to update our service:

#. Click on ``Step 3: POST to Modify HTTP_Service``. Review the **Request** URL 
   and JSON :guilabel:`Body`.  Notice that we are sending a ``POST`` to the 
   ``/mgmt/shared/appsvcs/declare`` endpoint.  We will send the **Full**
   declaration document with the pool members updated to so they are **NOT** 
   enabled:

   |lab-3-12|

#. Click the :guilabel:`Send` button to **Modify** the previously deployed
   HTTP_Service:

   |lab-3-13|

#. In the BIG-IP GUI click :menuselection:`Local Traffic --> Pools --> Pool List 
   --> Pool1 --> Members`.  Notice that there are no members listed in the 
   table.  Since AS3 is a fully declarative interface it does not configure
   pool members when their ``enable`` state is ``false`` as we specified in 
   the declaration.  The Virtual Server is no longer passing traffic at 
   ``http://10.1.20.121`` because no Members are available in the Pool:

   |lab-3-14|

Next, let's use the ``PATCH`` method to update our service:

#. Click on ``Step 4: PATCH to Modify Service_HTTP``.  Notice that we are using
   the ``PATCH`` method to the ``/mgmt/shared/appsvcs/declare`` endpoint.
   Review the JSON :guilabel:`Body`.  Notice that we are sending an array of 
   three operations using the RFC6902 JSON Patch format.  The first two operations
   in the array will update the ``enable`` state to ``true`` for our existing
   pool members.  The third operation adds a new Member to the Pool:

   |lab-3-15|

#. Click the :guilabel:`Send` button to update HTTP_Service.  Review the 
   **Response** :guilabel:`Body` and review the ``declaration`` to see how
   it was updated.
   
   |lab-3-16|
   
#. In the BIG-IP GUI click :menuselection:`Local Traffic --> Pools --> Pool List 
   --> Pool1 --> Members`.  Notice that there are now three members listed in the 
   table.  The Virtual Server is now available again at ``http://10.1.20.121`` 
   
   |lab-3-17|

Task 4 - Delete our Deployed Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The lifecycle of a service also includes the service removal.  We will now delete
an existing service.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

#. Click the ``Step 5: PATCH to Delete Service_HTTP`` request and review the
   JSON :guilabel:`Body`.  Notice the operation will ``remove`` the 
   ``/Tenant1/HTTP_Service`` object from the declaration. 

   |lab-3-18|

#. Click the :guilabel:`Send` button to send the request

#. Now that the service has been deleted, let's review the BIG-IP configuration.
   You can review via REST by sending the ``Step 1: Get Deployed AS3 Services``
   request again, or you can login to the BIG-IP A GUI to verify the objects
   have been removed.

   .. NOTE:: Since ``HTTP_Service`` was the only service in our tenant, AS3 will
      automatically remove the ``Tenant1`` partition from the BIG-IP since it
      is no longer required.

Task 5 - Deploy an HTTP Service with Custom created Profile and a referenced iRule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this task we will demonstrate the ``dry-run`` mode of AS3.  This mode allows
you to test the declaration but not apply **ANY** changes to the BIG-IP system.
This functionality is critical for integration into production automation
pipelines.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

#. Click the ``Step 6: Test Re-deploy Service_HTTP with iRule and Custom Profiles``
   request.  Review the JSON :guilabel:`Body`.  Notice that the our ``action``
   is ``dry-run``.  Click the :guilabel:`Send` button to send the request:

   |lab-3-19|

#. Review the **Response** :guilabel:`Body`.  Notice that the ``dryRun``  
   attribute is set and the ``message`` indicates the test was successful:

   |lab-3-20|

#. Click the ``Step 7: Re-deploy Service_HTTP with iRule and Custom Profiles`` 
   request.  Review the JSON :guilabel:`Body` and notice the ``action`` 
   is set to ``deploy``.  Click the :guilabel:`Send` button to deploy the
   service

#. AS3 can *Create* or *Reference* various objects.  In this deployment we 
   perform two actions:

   #. Create custom profiles on the BIG-IP device with various options
      specified.  These profiles do not exist on the BIG-IP but are created
      dynamically during the deployment.

   #. Create an iRule on the BIG-IP device by using a **URL Reference**.  
      AS3 downloads the iRule resource from the URL and then
      creates a new iRule object on the system.  The iRule object is then
      automatically linked to the Virtual Server

      .. WARNING:: When using URL references, it is important to properly secure
         the repository which hosts the resource(s).  The example in this lab
         uses a publicly readable repository, however, most environments should
         use a private repository with appropriate access control.

#. Review the **Request** JSON :guilabel:`Body` to see how the desired outcomes
   above were declared:

   - **Custom Profiles:**

     |lab-3-21|

   - **URL Referenced iRule:**

     |lab-3-22|

   - **iRule linked to Virtual Server:**

     |lab-3-23|

#. Open Chrome and connect to the Virtual Server at ``http://10.1.20.121``. The
   iRule that was attached to the service contains an ``HTTP_RESPOND`` event,
   which responds with a simple Maintenance Page.

   |lab-3-24|

Task 6 - Deploy an HTTPS Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

#. Click the ``Step 8: Deploy Service_HTTPS`` request and review the 
   **Request** JSON :guilabel:`Body` to see how the service was declared.
   Notice that we are performing a ``PATCH`` to the declaration and with an
   ``add`` operation:

   |lab-3-25|

#. :guilabel:`Send` the ``Step 8: Deploy Service_HTTPS`` request to deploy
   an HTTPS Service with an SSL/TLS Key, Certificate and Certificate Bundle 
   specified in the declaration.  

#. Review the configured Virtual Servers in the TMUI GUI.  AS3 created a new 
   Virtual Server to redirect ``TCP/80`` traffic to ``TCP/443``
   and configured the Virtual Server to listen on ``TCP/443``

   |lab-3-26|

#. The configuration of the Virtual Server now uses an SSL/TLS Client profile.  
   The deployment is now providing SSL Offload for the backend compute nodes.

   |lab-3-27|

#. Open Chrome and access the service with ``http://10.1.20.122``. It should
   redirect you to ``https://10.1.20.122``.

   |lab-3-28|

Task 7 - Deploy an HTTPS Service with a Web Application Firewall Policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another advantage of Service Deployment using AS3 is that they can
deploy advanced Layer 4-7 services using policies from various F5 modules.  
In this task we will update ``Service_HTTPS`` to include a Web Application 
Firewall policy.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

#. :guilabel:`Send` the ``Step 9: Modify Service_HTTPS to add WAF Policy`` 
   request to link a policy that will be used with the Application Security 
   Manager (ASM) module.  Review the JSON :guilabel:`Body` to see how the 
   policy was attached:

   |lab-3-29|

#. This deployment recognizes the need for Security from the beginning of the
   application lifecycle.  It lays the groundwork for **Continuous
   Improvement** by having the policy reside in a repository.  It allows us
   to treat resources as code leading to an Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
   methodology.  As the policy is updated in the repository, additional 
   automation and orchestration can be enabled to deploy the policy into the 
   environment.  The result is an ability to rapidly build, test and iterate 
   Layer 7 security policies and guarantee deployment into the environment.

#. In the TMUI GUI, you will notice a ASM policy has been applied to the 
   Virtual Server. In :guilabel:`Application Security`, we will be able to 
   observe that the policy is applied and set to Blocking mode.

   - **ASM Policy attached to Virtual Server:**

     |lab-3-30|

   - **ASM WAF Policy:**

     |lab-3-31|

Task 8 - Remove all Deployed Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We will now clean up the configuration of our BIG-IP by removing all the 
services we've deployed in this lab.  To accomplish this we will use the 
``POST`` method and simply declare an empty Tenant.  AS3 will remove all the
config on the device including the associated partition.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

#. Click the ``Step 10: POST to Delete All Services`` request.  Review the JSON
   :guilabel:`Body` and notice that we have declared an empty tenant:

   |lab-3-32|

#. Click the :guilabel:`Send` button to remove all services and the ``Tenant1``
   partition.

#. Send the ``Step 11: Get Deployed AS3 Services`` request.  Notice you receive
   a message indicating no declaration was found.
