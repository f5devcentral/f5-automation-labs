Lab |labmodule|\.\ |labnum|\: Deploy iApp Services using the REST API
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that the App Services iApp is installed on your BIG-IP A we
can deploy a Service. The Service in this Lab will go through
different iterations, we'll start with a `Basic HTTP Service`, `Modify` the
Services Node states and then `Delete` the whole Service. Once we've
seen the first `Mutation` of the Service we'll introduce some more complex
Services deployments with iRule's, Custom Profiles, Certificates and an ASM Policy.

..NOTE:: This lab work will be performed from the Lab 2.3 Postman Collection

|image2_8|

Task 1 - View Deployed Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

#. Execute Step 1 to show Services Deployed on BIG-IP A

|image2_9|

Review the JSON response, in this task we have requested a list of deployed
services from the BIG-IP, it has responded empty as nothing is installed yet.

|image2_10|

Task 2 - Deploy Basic HTTP Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Execute Step 2 to Deploy the Basic HTTP Service on BIG-IP A

|image2_11|

Review the JSON Body that was sent, and the JSON Body that responded,
in this task we Deployed our first Service. From the JSON body that was
sent we can see the variables we're requesting inserted into the iApp
template, `we've just progressed to ``Declarative`` instantiation`, defining
the end state and letting the BIG-IP handle the order of operations and
configuration.

|image2_12|

Now that the Service is deployed, lets look on the BIG-IP for the new deployment.
You can either repeat Task 1 Step 1 via of this Lab and view via REST or you can
login to the BIG-IP A GUI and see the service deployed.

|image2_13|

|image2_14|

From the GUI exam the Virtual Server that was created from this deployment
its very generic, but it does contain all the needed pieces to create an
active HTTP service, contains a HTTP profile, VIP address, and a Pool with
members in an Active state.

|image2_15|

This service is up and Active, you can go to the VIP address of
``http://10.1.20.120`` and see it working.

|image2_31|

Task 3 - Modify our Deployed Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Execute Step 3 to Modify the Basic HTTP Service on BIG-IP A

|image2_16|

Modifying or "Reconfiguring" a Service is handled by only sending the pieces
of the JSON need updated, this is to the deployed Service Name. For the last two
steps we were looking at Services as a whole for the BIG-IP, in a modify call you
are modifying only the singular endpoint (the Service) review the REST endpoint
and that is specific, and the JSON body that all we need to send is the new
"State" Attributes and Values.

|image2_17|

Back on the BIG-IP GUI after the Service is Modified we can see the new state of
the Pool Members reflecting the state we declared in the REST call. Now the VIP
is also no longer passing traffic to ``http://10.1.20.120``

|image2_18|

Task 4 - Delete our Deployed Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Execute Step 4 to Delete the Basic HTTP Service on BIG-IP A

|image2_19|

Like a Modification, the Deletion of the Service happens to the REST endpoint
of the Service itself. When we created the Service we had a Declared state to
build all the objects, the BIG-IP handled the operation of creating all the
objects requested and in the correct order, for a Deletion we will request the
Delete and the BIG-IP will process all the removal of the linked objects (ASO's)
in the correct order too. This is crucial to Application Lifecycle Management
as it provides the mechanism to make sure all parts of the Service are
deleted, not leaving behind unneeded items. There is no JSON body to a Delete
call as the HTTP Method is defining the Action. Verify on the BIP-IP either
by the REST call in Step 1 or by checkin the GUI iApps > Application Services.

|image2_10|

|image2_20|

Task 5 - Deploy an HTTP Service with Custom created Profile and a referenced iRule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Execute Step 5 Deploy the HTTP Service with Custom Profiles and an iRule on BIG-IP A

|image2_21|

Review the JSON body, in this task we created a new Service, but its different
then the original one created earlier; the App Service Integration iApp
contains the mechanisms within it self to Create items, and reference items
via a URL path. This new Service we created also created some new profiles
for us (Protocol, Compression, HTTP and OneConnect). We have also attached a
new iRule to the Virtual server, which did not exist on the BIG-IP, it was
fetched during the instantiation of the Service from the GitHub Repository that
is housing our Lab.

Created Profiles:

|image2_22|

URL Reference iRule:

|image2_23|

GUI of iRule applied to Virtual Server

|image2_24|

Try and Hit the VIP at ``http://10.1.20.120``, the iRule that was attached to
the Service contains an HTTP RESPOND, typically used for Maintenance Page
solutions, relieving that configuration from needed to be swapped on the
backend service Nodes.

|image2_25|

Task 6 - Deploy an HTTPS Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Execute Step 6 Deploy the HTTPS Service on BIG-IP A

|image2_26|

Because iApps are a Declarative Interface we can modify the whole deployment
without the need to Destroy it, this also means we can re-name objects, `if`
we needed too. In the above call we Declared a new state of the Service,
we requested that it continue to use the Created Profiles, but we removed
the iRule, and we had the BIG-IP fetch some SSL objects (Certs, Key and Chain).
Because we are moving to an SSL Service, we've also changed the Listener Port to
443 and applied the needed Client SSL Profile.

|image2_27|

From the BIG-IP GUI the Virtual Server has changed, the App Services Integration
iApp has created a Port 80 > 443 remap, and created the 443 VIP.

|image2_28|

The configuration of the VIP now has our new SSL Client profile, and its
assigned, meaning this VIP is providing SSL Offload for the service Node
behind.

|image2_29|

Try accessing the Service with both ``http://10.1.20.120`` it should redirect
you to ``https://10.1.20.120``.

.. NOTE:: We are using self signed certificate in the lab so ssl warning will
   still be shown

|image2_30|

Task 7 - Deploy an HTTPS Service with an ASM Policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Execute Step 7 Deploy the HTTPS Service with an ASM Policy on BIG-IP A

|image2_32|

Adding on to the deployment of the Service in the last Task, this deployment
also grabs an ASM policy from our GitHub repository and applies it to the
Virtual Server as a Policy item. This deployment is recognizing the Security
teams Policy into our environment, and lays the ground work for
`Continuous Improvement` as the ASM policy needs to be updated as Code, we can
deploy that right back onto the Virtual Server reconfiguring the Service.

ASM Policy URL:

|image2_34|

Layer 7 Policy Rules:

|image2_35|

Layer 7 Policy Actions:

|image2_33|

From the BIG-IP A GUI we can see the Layer 7 Policy Applied to the Virtual
Server, and from the Application Security Manager Module we can see applied
policy and that its set to Blocking mode.

|image2_36|

|image2_37|

Task 8 - Module 2 Clean Up
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. In preparations for the next lab, please run Task 4 and Delete your Service.
