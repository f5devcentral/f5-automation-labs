Lab |labmodule|\.\ |labnum|\: update\_pool\_member\_state.py
------------------------------------------------------------

One of the most common tasks asked for by customers is the ability to
set a pool memberâ€™s state via a script. We have included an example of
such a script in the lab that can be used to see how easy
it is to automate specific operational tasks.

Task 1 - Run update\_pool\_member\_state.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. In the command prompt type
   ``python update_pool_member_state.py 10.1.1.4 test_pool 10.1.10.10:80 disabled``
   and examine the output.

#. Verify the pool member was disabled via TMUI

#. Re-run the script with as
   ``python update_pool_member_state.py --help`` to see additional options.

#. Re-enable the pool member using the script
