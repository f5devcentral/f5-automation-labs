Lab |labmodule|\.\ |labnum|\: Install the f5-postman-workflows Framework
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this lab you will walk through installing the f5-postman-workflows
framework into the Postman REST Client.

Task 1 - Import the f5-postman-workflows Postman Collection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this task you will Import a Postman Collection that contains Installation
helpers, Examples and a automated Test Framework.  The collection is installed
from the f5-postman-workflows GitHub repository.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

#. Open the Postman Client on your jumphost by clicking the |image8| icon
#. Click the 'Import' button in the top left of the Postman window
#. Click the 'Import from Link' tab.  Paste the following URL into the
   text box and click 'Import'

   ``https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xHiteshPatel/f5-postman-workflows/master/F5_Postman_Workflows.postman_collection.json``

#. You should now see a collection named ``F5_Postman_Workflows`` in your
   Postman Collections sidebar, in some cases the Collections dont appear until Postman
   has been closed an relaunched.

Task 2 - Install f5-postman-workflows into your Postman Client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To utilize the helper functions the framework includes, we must install those
functions into the Postman Client.  The installation helpers perform the
following tasks:

#. Determine the most current version of the framework
#. Dynamically minify the JavaScript code from the f5-postman-workflows
   GitHub repository using Google's Closure Compiler
#. Install the minified JS code into a Postman Global Variable
#. Set a number of Global variables that allow you to configure various
   options

To install the framework complete the following tasks:

#. Open the ``F5_Postman_Workflows`` collection
#. Open the ``Install`` folder
#. Select the ``Check f5-postman-workflows Version`` item and click 'Send'
#. Examine the 'Tests' portion of the **RESPONSE**:
