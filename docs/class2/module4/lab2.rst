Lab |labmodule|\.\ |labnum| - Executing Jenkins Jobs for Creation or Modify
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that we have Jenkins running, and the dependent Slack Plugin installed
we can utilize our Jenkins Pipeline Scripts successfully.

Task 1 - Building the Application Service Framework via Jenkins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This step is executing the f5-newman-wrapper files. Instead of having to run the two different
builds (Application Service Framework and Pool member add) individually we'll us a pause.
Jenkins has a pause functionality which pausing the deployment looking for an approval to
continue. After the approving step, the node to be added, still using 2 f5-newman-wrapper
files but in conjunction with a single solution (Jenkins). Jenkins will continue to update
the class via Slack as people are progressing. Jenkins does also keep a running console for
logging, which we will also review.

#. From the Jenkins Dashboard click on ``create new jobs``

   |image103|

#. We are going to create our first Pipeline Job. Name the item ``module_4_jenkinsfile1-2``, choose the ``Pipeline`` project style and select ``OK``

   |image104|

#. We are going to be using the raw ``Jenkinsfile1-2`` right in the ``Pipeline Script`` option at the end of the config page. Scroll to the bottom of the page but **please look at the other options** which can deploy a Pipeline. The different options in here are for an SCM (like GitHub), the ``Polling`` or ``Commit`` methods enable Continuous Deployment, as Jenkins will deploy the change on an event basis. Tie this with automatic testing to make sure you're not breaking the build!

   |image105|

#. We need to enter the contents of the ``Jenkinsfile1-2`` into the ``Script`` section under Pipeline. After the contents are added click the ``Save`` Option.

#. Once the Job is saved, you will be taken to the stage view page, from here we are going to execute our Pipeline build, choose the ``Build Now`` option.

   |image107|

#. The Build is now running, and the stages are being executed in order. However, on our third stage we have a **pause** and an approval **needed**. Also at the same time Slack has began to notify us that a new service is being deployed, and someone needs to approve it.

   |image108|
   Highlight over the third Stage to prompt for the Approval
   |image109|

   |image110|

#. Approve the change in Jenkins to allow the build to finish. Once this is done, the approval and finished Slack notification will be sent.

   |image111|

   |image112|

#. At the end of the Build event (success or failure) there is a console output from Jenkins. Select the blue globe on the left to see the outputs

   |image113|

#. The Console Output file not only contains the Jenkins output from the Build, but also the f5-newman-wrapper toolkit logs for easy troubleshooting

   |image114|

#. Check Slack for the completion of everything!

   |image115|

#. Verify on the BIG-IP that the pool ``module_3_vs`` has been created and the services are Green

   |image117|

Task 2 - Jenkinsfile3 and Jenkinsfile4
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These two Jenkins files were completed to show the ability of creating smaller deployments. In our case we will use the f5-newman-wrapper toolkit to again change the user selected state of a pool member. The different Pipelines notifications also have different Slack Color depictions, helping to quickly identify issues to team members.

#. Return to the Jenkins Dashboard and select ``New Item``

   |image116|

#. Repeat steps 2 & 3 of the last module, creating 2 new Jenkins jobs, one for each desired node state.

#. Create and Execute ``module_4_jenkinsfile_3`` for a down node
