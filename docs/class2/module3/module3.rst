Module 3: Stitching Workflows from Class 1 into new Orchestratable Collections
==============================================================================

In the previous module we saw the example of stitching together the Authentication
Folder and some facts gathering. We will now stitch together the Postman
Collection from Class 1 and the Authentication Collection from Module 2. Once we
validate the new file we'll use f5-newman-wrapper to execute.

Stitching together the collections and workflows allows Super-NetOps engineers
the ability to start quickly Orchestrating calls running Automation workflows.
This also allows BIG-IP to be Orchestrated from upper level orchestration toolkits.

Using this structure allows you to build your own solutions, to manage BIG-IP
quickly as native REST calls are used.
